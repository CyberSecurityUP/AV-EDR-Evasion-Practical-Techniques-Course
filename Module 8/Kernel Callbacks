// ⚠️ Requires a driver to enumerate kernel callbacks.
// Instructor: Joas A Santos

/*
NOTE: This technique involves reading kernel memory (e.g., PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine array).
You must use a driver like "KDMapper" with a vulnerable driver like RTCore64 to access kernel space.

Summary steps:
1. Map vulnerable driver (BYOVD).
2. Read memory at PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine address.
3. Analyze callbacks for EDRs.

To avoid legal/OS crash risks, this part will be provided as a PoC driver separately if desejado.
